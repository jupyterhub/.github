  Hi there :wave:!

  I noticed that this new issue/PR doesn't provide any description, so I labeled it with `needs-more-info`.
  
  In order for us to be able to review your contribution and answer questions more quickly, please
  describe it in more detail. A thorough description will also help people from the future, who
  are looking for some quick context around this set of changes.

  A great way to start is to follow <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/.github/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE">issue templates</a> or the repository specific
  PR template (if any). Ultimately, the most important question to answer in your
  description is: *what goal do you want to achieve with this change?*.

  Thank you! :heart:
